# Benford's Law {#sec-benford}

Benford's law states that the distribution of leading digits in a population naturally follows a certain distribution. In auditing, assessing whether a distribution of digits in the population conforms to Benford's law may provide additional evidence that the transactions in the population might need further investigation. Non-conformity to Benford's law does not necessarily indicate fraud. A Benford's law analysis should therefore only be used to acquire insight into whether a population might need further investigation.
