# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

Statistical theory is fundamental to many auditing guidelines and procedures. Auditors need user-friendly software for statistical analyses and the knowledge to interpret these results. JASP [@JASP] is an open-source, free, cross-platform statistical software that supports statistical auditing through its Audit module [@Derks2021_jasp].

The Audit module allows auditors to plan, perform, and interpret most statistical auditing procedures using correct methods, minimizing programming errors. Designed with auditors in mind, it features a user-friendly interface aligned with audit processes and International Standards on Auditing. Besides standard frequentist methods, the module includes Bayesian methods to enhance audit transparency and efficiency by incorporating existing information. In summary, the Audit module handles the statistical heavy lifting, enabling you to plan, evaluate, and interpret your analyses using both classical and Bayesian techniques.

## Downloading JASP

The Audit module is a part of JASP, which can be freely downloaded from [www.jasp-stats.org](www.jasp-stats.org). Click the 'Download JASP' button on the homepage to access the download page and choose your preferred installation. JASP is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. Installation follows standard procedures.

You are now ready to perform statistical audit analyses using the Audit module.

## Working with the Audit module

The Audit module is a powerful tool for statistical analysis in auditing. The following sections cover its accessibility features, including help files and result validation using the R package jfa.

### Help files

After opening an analysis in the Audit module, click the blue 'i' icon next to the analysis title to access a help file describing its functionality. For some options, like sampling units and algorithms, additional help files are available, indicated by a blue 'i' icon next to the option.

### Validation of statistical results

The Audit module's statistical results are derived from the R package jfa [@jfa]. For complete documentation and benchmarks, visit the package website at [https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/).
